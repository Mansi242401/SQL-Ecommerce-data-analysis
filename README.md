# SQL-Ecommerce-data-analysis

## Project Overview

As an Ecommerce Data Analyst collaborating with the CEO, Marketing Director, and Website Manager, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to optimize marketing channels, measure website conversion performance, and assess the impact of new product launches. This project involves SQL analysis using MySQL Workbench.

I have restricted the scope of analysis to a very critical and fundamental table, "orders," which hosts key data that database analysts often work with. Among these tables, "orders" is particularly crucial for every ecommerce company, serving as the primary source of revenue. The analysis starts here and extends to related tables, aiming to understand the contributions of marketing activities to orders and evaluate the overall performance of the website.

(Note: I have ommitted the rows in between as github doesn't support large files) 

## Project Objectives

1. Access and explore the ecommerce database.
2. Analyze and optimize marketing channels ([Traffic Source Analysis](https://github.com/Mansi242401/SQL-Ecommerce-data-analysis/blob/main/Traffic_source_analysis.md)), website performance, and the product portfolio.

## Database Overview

The database comprises six interconnected tables containing ecommerce data related to website activity, products, orders, and refunds.

(Note: I utilized [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) for constructing the ER diagram, providing a visual representation of the database structure.)

## Analysis Highlights

The analysis focuses on:
1. Understanding customer interactions with the website. 
2. Gaining insights into landing page performance and conversion rates.
3. Exploring sales at the product level.



This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and data analysis techniques (including data modeling), providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the ecommerce domain.
Feel free to explore the [SQL file](https://github.com/Mansi242401/SQL-Ecommerce-data-analysis/blob/main/create_ecomdata.sql) and [dbdiagram.io](https://github.com/Mansi242401/SQL-Ecommerce-data-analysis/blob/main/Ecommerce.png) to gain a deeper understanding of the analysis conducted.
