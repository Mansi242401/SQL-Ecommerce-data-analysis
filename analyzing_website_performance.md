By:  Website Manager
Date : June 09, 2012

Could you help me get my head around the website by pulling the most-viewed website pages, ranked by session volume?

**QUERY:**


```sql

SELECT pageview_url, 
COUNT(website_session_id) AS session_count
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-09'
GROUP BY pageview_url;

```

**Result:**

| pageview_url                   | session_count |
|---------------------------------|---------------|
| /home                           | 10403         |
| /products                       | 4239          |
| /the-original-mr-fuzzy          | 3037          |
